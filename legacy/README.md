# Legacy .NET Framework 4.7.2 Project

This folder contains the old .NET Framework 4.7.2 version of RenameFiles.

**This code is deprecated and kept for reference only.**

The current version uses .NET 8 and is located in the parent directory.

## Old Project Structure

- `RenameFiles/` - Old .NET Framework project files
- `RenameFilesWizard/` - Visual Studio Installer Project (.vdproj)

## Migration Notes

The project was migrated to .NET 8 to enable:
- Single-file executable deployment
- Cross-platform development (macOS → Windows)
- Modern tooling and faster builds
